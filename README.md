# SOUND TO PRESS
Hi! I wrote this program simply because I was inspired by a video on YouTube. Good luck!
# How does it work?
1. Connect the microphone to your PC.
2. Launch the program.
3. You make a sound, for example, a clap.
**And the program should write that it heard the sound!**
# What is this program for?
1. Play something! (Like Geometry Dash)
2. Experements!
3. Just for fun
